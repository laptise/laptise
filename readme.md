# Hey, I'm Yoonsoo 👋

**AI Infrastructure Engineer & Founder — Building the memory layer for AI agents.**

I'm a Korean engineer based in Tokyo 🇯🇵 since 2006, currently building [Neuradex](https://neuradex.ai/) — a **Context as a Service (CaaS)** platform that gives AI agents persistent, structured memory.

Before writing code, I wrote music. 🎸 → 💻

### 🧠 What I'm Building

**[Neuradex](https://neuradex.ai/)** — Memory infrastructure for AI agents

Context Folding, Stateful Agent Orchestration, Knowledge Graphs — the pieces that make AI agents actually remember and reason across sessions. Built on a Neo4j + Qdrant + PostgreSQL hybrid architecture.

### 🔧 What I Do Day-to-Day

LLM-powered contract review systems at a legal tech startup. RAG pipelines, knowledge graphs, multi-database architectures. Full stack — infra to UI.

### How I Work

I ship with AI. My daily toolkit looks like:

| Layer | Tools |
|-------|-------|
| **Coding** | Claude Code (Max), Codex, Cursor |
| **AI Infra** | LangFuse, OpenRouter, Fireworks AI |
| **Core Stack** | TypeScript, Next.js, NestJS, Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Neo4j, Qdrant |
| **Deploy** | AWS, GCP (Cloud Run), Vercel, Cloudflare Workers |
| **Mail** | Docker, Terraform, GitHub Actions |

I once juggled 8 freelance projects simultaneously — that would've been impossible without AI. Now I'm building the infrastructure that makes AI itself work better.

### 🎸 Origin Story

Guitarist → Bassist → Composer → Sound Engineer → Producer → ran a music production company → built a booking system for live shows → one thing led to another → now I'm here, engineering context windows instead of mixing consoles.
